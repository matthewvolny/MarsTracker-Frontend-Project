                After traveling more than 352 million miles (566 million km)
                through space, Curiosity landed safely inside Gale Crater on
                Aug. 5, 2012 (Pacific Time). The rover settled down within
                driving distance of its ultimate destination: Mount Sharp, which
                is known more formally as Aeolis Mons.
